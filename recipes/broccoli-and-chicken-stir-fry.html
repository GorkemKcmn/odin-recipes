    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high until shimmery,
        about 2 minutes. Meanwhile, stir together chicken and 1 tablespoon of
        the cornstarch in a medium bowl until chicken is coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add chicken to skillet in a single layer and cook, stirring often, until
        crisp and cooked through, about 6 minutes. Add onions, and cook,
        stirring often, until translucent, about 1 minute. Add ginger and
        garlic; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute.
        Transfer chicken mixture to a plate and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add broccoli to empty skillet, and cook over medium-high, stirring
        occasionally, until bright green and heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, whisk together water, soy sauce, oyster sauce, brown sugar,
        crushed red pepper, black pepper, and remaining 2 tablespoons cornstarch
        in a small bowl until smooth, about 30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add cooked chicken mixture to broccoli in skillet; add soy sauce mixture
        and cook, stirring constantly, until broccoli and chicken are well
        coated, and sauce thickens, about 2 minutes.
